        "solution": "the original bill was 81. since they split the bill evenly, the original bill had to be divisible by 3. when the waiter gave them a discount and they decided to give it back as a tip, this amount didnt affect the division of the bill among the three. for alices statement to hold true, the discounted bill must also be divisible by 3, because it is an amount that each would pay if they split it. alices part after adding the tip (1/3 of the discounted bill) is essentially the discounted total. every dollar in the discounted total represents 3 in the original bill. since alice refuses to use coins, the discounted bill is a whole dollar amount that is a multiple of 3. lets start from a reasonable amount for a meal for three and work our way up 24 (adding the tip makes it 32, not divisible by 3), 27 (adding the tip makes it 36, which is divisible by 3). if the discounted bill was 27, each person would contribute 9. consequently, the original bill would be 27 + 9 = 36 in total, which is not correct since alice would have said she paid less than the original bill. moving up, the discounted bill totaling 36 (where each person pays 12) would lead to an original 36 + 12 = 48, and so on. the next plausible discounted total is 45 (each paying 15), leading to 45 + 15 = 60 original bill, which is still incorrect following alices observation. the next possible discounted total that follows this pattern is 54 (each paying 18). this leads to an original bill of 54 + 18 = 72. still, alices observation does not hold. the next discounted bill total could be 63 (each paying 21), leading to an original bill of 63 + 21 = 84. however, it doesnt satisfy alices comment because its not an exact dollar amount as per her spending habit. since alices individual payment must be a whole number, lets try the next multiple of 3, which would be 27 (which is also divisible by 3). the discounted bill would then equal 81 and the original bill 81 + 27 = 108, which is not divisible by 3. moving down to 27 each on a discounted bill would mean a 81 total, and an original bill of 81 + 27 = 108. since 108 is not divisible by three, it still wouldnt be correct. since alice, bob, and charlie pay whole dollars, we missed a multiplication earlierthe discounted bill must be 27 for each person. thus the original bill is three times that (27 * 3), which is 81. alice pays her third, 27, as if it were the discounted price, so the original price must be 81.",
